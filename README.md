# IOT-hotel-simulation
This is a university project simulating an IOT solution for a fictional hotel, using Docker to build the system, and using an mqtt brocker to communicate via the subscription model. It also has the code to use a raspberry pi3 as a way to connect sensors to its GPIO pins and expand the system to something tangible.
The solution is primarily written in python 3, and has a web interface to display the information collected by the different sensor in the rooms, it also allows command to be sent via the web interface.
The system uses MariaDB to set a database so room numbers are stored, and the sensor information is accessible to the system.
PS:
The IP direcctions that may appear are not personal neither are associated to the university, they were given by Google Cloud, the machines that hosted this project are long gone.
